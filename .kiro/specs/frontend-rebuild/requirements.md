# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves rebuilding the frontend of ACM Manager 2024, a management platform for a self-storage company with 17 facilities and 2 salon locations. The current frontend lacks coherent structure and organization, while the backend (authentication, database, APIs) is solid and functional. The rebuild will create a clean, mobile-first interface that consolidates management operations into a unified platform, replacing spreadsheet-based workflows with proper data visualization and role-based access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Role-Based Navigation System

**User Story:** As a user with a specific role (Manager, Area Manager, Admin), I want to see only the navigation options and data relevant to my permissions, so that I can focus on my responsibilities without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager logs in THEN the system SHALL display navigation limited to Dashboard, My Payroll, My Location, and Settings
2. WHEN an Area Manager logs in THEN the system SHALL display navigation for Dashboard, Team Payroll, Locations, Reports, and Settings
3. WHEN an Admin user logs in THEN the system SHALL display full navigation including Dashboard, Payroll, Locations, Reports, Admin, and Settings
4. WHEN a user attempts to access a route outside their permissions THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page
5. IF a user has multi-location access THEN the system SHALL provide unified views across their assigned locations

### Requirement 2: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a facility manager who primarily uses mobile devices, I want the application to work seamlessly on my phone and tablet, so that I can access information and complete tasks while on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL use bottom tab navigation for primary sections
2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL use a collapsible sidebar navigation
3. WHEN data tables are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL convert them to scrollable card layouts
4. WHEN charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain readability across all screen sizes
5. WHEN interactive elements are presented THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility

### Requirement 3: Dashboard-Centric Landing Experience

**User Story:** As a user logging into the system, I want to immediately see the most relevant information for my role and quick access to common actions, so that I can efficiently start my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager logs in THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard showing their location's key metrics and personal payroll quick access
2. WHEN an Area Manager logs in THEN the system SHALL display a multi-location overview with team management shortcuts
3. WHEN an Admin logs in THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive dashboard with admin tools access
4. WHEN dashboard cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL stack on mobile and use grid layout on larger screens
5. WHEN key metrics show unusual patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight alerts or flags for attention

### Requirement 4: Clean Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want components to be organized in a logical, reusable structure, so that I can efficiently add features and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL organize them by feature domain (payroll, locations, dashboard, etc.)
2. WHEN UI components are needed THEN the system SHALL use a consistent design system based on Shadcn/ui
3. WHEN business logic components are created THEN the system SHALL separate them from presentation components
4. WHEN shared utilities are needed THEN the system SHALL organize them in clearly defined lib directories
5. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns for consistency

### Requirement 5: Data Visualization Integration

**User Story:** As a manager reviewing performance data, I want to see information presented in clear charts and graphs, so that I can quickly understand trends and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL use Recharts for consistent data visualization
2. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL integrate properly with Tailwind CSS styling
3. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL display meaningful empty states
5. WHEN charts are interactive THEN the system SHALL provide hover states and tooltips for additional context

### Requirement 6: Server-Side Data Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator concerned about security and performance, I want all database operations to happen server-side, so that sensitive data is protected and the application performs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is needed THEN the system SHALL use React Server Components for initial data loading
2. WHEN client-side state is required THEN the system SHALL minimize it and use appropriate state management
3. WHEN database queries are made THEN the system SHALL execute them server-side only
4. WHEN API routes are created THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization
5. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL ensure it never reaches the client unnecessarily

### Requirement 7: Payroll System Integration

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to view my payroll information in a clear, organized way, so that I can understand my compensation and track my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN employees view payroll THEN the system SHALL display their personal payroll details with bonus status and commission tracking
2. WHEN multi-location employees view payroll THEN the system SHALL provide unified views across all their locations
3. WHEN Area Managers view payroll THEN the system SHALL show direct reports' payroll information within their permissions
4. WHEN Admin processes payroll THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive payroll management tools
5. WHEN payroll data is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper data isolation based on user roles

### Requirement 8: Performance and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application, I want pages to load quickly and show clear feedback when data is being fetched, so that I understand the system is working and can plan my actions accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are loading THEN the system SHALL display skeleton loaders or progress indicators
2. WHEN data fetching fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with retry options
3. WHEN large datasets are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling
4. WHEN images or charts are loading THEN the system SHALL show placeholder content
5. WHEN network requests are slow THEN the system SHALL provide timeout handling and user feedback

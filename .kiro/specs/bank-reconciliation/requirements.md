# Bank Reconciliation System - Requirements

## Introduction

This project involves creating a Bank Reconciliation System for ACM's monthly financial close process. The system will help the Office Manager match daily payments from storage management software against actual bank transactions, with approval workflow from the Director of Accounting (Admin role). The system will handle multiple facilities with different bank accounts and track discrepancies for audit purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Monthly Reconciliation Management

**User Story:** As an Office Manager, I want to initiate and manage monthly reconciliations for all facilities, so that I can systematically close out each month's financial data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new reconciliation THEN the system SHALL create a reconciliation record for the selected month/year
2. WHEN viewing reconciliations THEN the system SHALL show status (in_progress, pending_review, completed) for each facility
3. WHEN a reconciliation is in progress THEN the system SHALL track who created it and when
4. WHEN a reconciliation needs review THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to Director of Accounting
5. WHEN a reconciliation is completed THEN the system SHALL record completion timestamp and user

### Requirement 2: Automatic Transaction Matching

**User Story:** As an Office Manager, I want the system to automatically suggest matches between bank transactions and daily payments, so that I can efficiently process the majority of transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing daily payments THEN the system SHALL combine cash + check amounts for matching
2. WHEN processing daily payments THEN the system SHALL combine all credit card amounts (visa, mastercard, amex, discover, diners, debit) for matching
3. WHEN matching transactions THEN the system SHALL match by date and amount within the same facility's bank account
4. WHEN automatic matches are found THEN the system SHALL flag them for Office Manager review
5. WHEN no automatic match is found THEN the system SHALL list transactions as unmatched for manual processing

### Requirement 3: Manual Matching and Discrepancy Handling

**User Story:** As an Office Manager, I want to manually match complex transactions and document discrepancies, so that I can handle multi-day combinations, refunds, and errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN manual matching is needed THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to link bank transactions to daily payments
2. WHEN discrepancies exist THEN the system SHALL allow documentation of discrepancy type (multi_day_combination, refund, error, other)
3. WHEN documenting discrepancies THEN the system SHALL require description and amount fields
4. WHEN discrepancies are created THEN the system SHALL require approval from Director of Accounting
5. WHEN partial matches occur THEN the system SHALL track the difference amount and reason

### Requirement 4: Review and Approval Workflow

**User Story:** As Director of Accounting (Admin), I want to review and approve reconciliations and discrepancies, so that I can ensure accuracy before month-end close.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reconciliation is ready for review THEN the system SHALL notify Director of Accounting
2. WHEN reviewing discrepancies THEN the system SHALL show all unmatched items and documented reasons
3. WHEN approving discrepancies THEN the system SHALL record approval timestamp and user
4. WHEN rejecting items THEN the system SHALL return them to Office Manager with notes
5. WHEN all items are approved THEN the system SHALL allow final reconciliation completion

### Requirement 5: Multi-Facility Bank Account Management

**User Story:** As an Office Manager, I want to reconcile all facilities simultaneously while respecting their separate bank accounts, so that I can efficiently manage the entire portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting reconciliation THEN the system SHALL process all facilities for the selected month
2. WHEN matching transactions THEN the system SHALL only match within the same facility's bank account
3. WHEN displaying progress THEN the system SHALL show completion status per facility
4. WHEN viewing unmatched items THEN the system SHALL group by facility and bank account
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide both facility-specific and consolidated views

### Requirement 6: Audit Trail and Reporting

**User Story:** As Director of Accounting, I want comprehensive audit trails and discrepancy reports, so that I can maintain proper financial controls and provide documentation for audits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions are matched THEN the system SHALL record who matched them and when
2. WHEN discrepancies are created or approved THEN the system SHALL maintain complete audit trail
3. WHEN generating audit reports THEN the system SHALL show all matching activity with timestamps and users
4. WHEN generating discrepancy reports THEN the system SHALL summarize by type, amount, and status
5. WHEN exporting reports THEN the system SHALL provide CSV/PDF formats for external use

### Requirement 7: September 2024 Pilot Implementation

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to test the reconciliation system with September 2024 data, so that I can validate the process before full deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading September 2024 data THEN the system SHALL import all relevant bank transactions and daily payments
2. WHEN running pilot reconciliation THEN the system SHALL demonstrate all matching and discrepancy workflows
3. WHEN testing approval process THEN the system SHALL validate Director of Accounting review capabilities
4. WHEN generating pilot reports THEN the system SHALL produce audit trail and discrepancy reports for September
5. WHEN pilot is successful THEN the system SHALL be ready for production use with other months

# Frontend Rebuild Plan - ACM Manager 2024

## Project Overview

**Created:** July 25, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Branch:** `frontend-rebuild-2025`
**Approach:** Methodical, incremental rebuild with testing at each step

---

## 1. Application Discovery & Requirements

### Core Application Purpose

**Industry:** Self Storage Management Company
**Scale:** 17 Self Storage facilities + 2 Salon locations + Management company operations
**Primary Software:** Sitelink (by Storable/SMD) for day-to-day facility operations
**Vision:** Management layer above Sitelink that consolidates metrics, reports, and operations into unified platform

**Key Problems Solved:**

- Replaces hodgepodge of spreadsheets and separate reports
- Centralizes management operations (payroll, payables, store monitoring, hiring, firing, owner interactions)
- Provides better metric visualization and reporting for management team
- Creates single source of truth for multi-location oversight

### Target Users & Roles

**ADMIN/ACM Office Staff (5 people):**

- **David** - Manager of Technology & Accounting (monthly financials, cash flow, deposits verification, owner distributions, payroll, tech oversight)
- **Jacque** - Director of Operations (everything oversight, day-to-day ops, area manager supervision, facility communication, bank signatures, payables, repairs/maintenance, owner communication)
- **Ashley** - Office Manager (mail, bill entry to QuickBooks, bank reconciliation, deposit verification, payroll support, general office operations)
- **Jayden** - Director of Marketing (remote, marketing ROI optimization, manager coordination for offsite marketing, web/SEO team communication)
- **Brad** - Owner (hands-off day-to-day, owns some facilities directly, high-level oversight)

**SUPERVISOR/Area Managers (3 people):**

- **Andrea, Tabatha, Ezra** - Direct supervisors to facility managers/assistants, need location performance visibility, staff performance monitoring, payroll participation, deposit alert access
- _Note: Tabatha also manages a location; Ezra floats between locations_

**MANAGER/Facility Managers:**

- **Scope:** Typically single facility, full-time
- **Responsibilities:** Unit rentals, rent collection, past-due follow-up, auctions, facility cleanliness, maintenance coordination, "ownership mentality" for their location

**ASSISTANT/Assistant Managers:**

- **Scope:** Same responsibilities as managers but under manager supervision, part-time, sometimes multi-location
- **Access:** Similar to managers but potentially more limited

**Future Vision:** Scalable for other management companies with potentially different organizational structures

### Primary Use Cases

**Core Workflows (Iterative Discovery):**

**High Priority - Known Needs:**

1. **Bi-weekly Payroll Processing** (every 2 weeks)

   - Admin/Office staff: Process payroll for all locations
   - Managers/Assistants: View own payroll details, bonus status, commission tracking
   - Area Managers: View direct reports' payroll information

2. **Executive Dashboard** (daily/weekly monitoring)

   - Area Managers and above: Key metrics overview
   - Alert system: Flag unusual patterns (low rentals, delayed deposits, etc.)
   - Performance monitoring across locations

3. **Employee Performance Tracking**
   - Bonus calculations based on monthly rentals
   - Commission tracking from new rentals
   - Individual vs location performance metrics

**Flexible/Iterative Areas:**

- User adoption will drive additional feature priorities
- Real-world usage will reveal most valuable workflows
- Features will be added/refined based on actual user feedback

**Note:** Limited current user base means iterative approach is essential

### Current Pain Points

**What Works (Keep/Improve):**

- ‚úÖ Payroll pages functionality is largely good
- ‚úÖ Deposits page concept is solid
- ‚úÖ Front page data display is helpful

**Major Issues to Fix:**

- ‚ùå Client-side DB calls (need server-side handling)
- ‚ùå Payroll only shows by store (need employee view for multi-location staff)
- ‚ùå Deposits page incomplete (needs rebuild)
- ‚ùå Front page data needs rework
- ‚ùå Poor mobile/tablet experience (need mobile-first priority)
- ‚ùå Inadequate data isolation/security by role
- ‚ùå Information feels like "hodgepodge" - poor organization
- ‚ùå Not fluid UX experience

**Critical Security/Access Requirements:**

- Managers: See OWN payroll + own store data only
- Area Managers: See direct reports' payroll + their assigned stores (metrics access TBD)
- Office Staff: Full access as needed
- Multi-location staff: Need unified view across their locations

**Overall Status:** Currently in beta mode - everything is fair game for rebuild

## 2. Technical Foundation

### Backend Status

‚úÖ **SOLID** - User authentication, role-based permissions, facility-based access control, database integration

### Frontend Technology Stack

‚úÖ **DECIDED**

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (existing, with App Router)
- **UI Library:** Shadcn/ui (familiar, customizable, business-appropriate)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (existing, excellent for rapid development)
- **State Management:** React Server Components + minimal client state (Zustand for complex client state if needed)
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts (React-native, excellent Tailwind integration)
- **Additional Tools:**
  - React Hook Form (forms with validation)
  - Zod (schema validation)
  - Date-fns (date manipulation)
  - Lucide React (icons, already in use)

---

## 3. Design & User Experience Plan

### Design System

**Current Status:** Foundation exists (Shadcn/ui + Tailwind), needs organization and enhancement

**Color Palette:**

- **Current**: Blue/purple theme with light/dark mode support
- **Business Context**: Professional, modern feel suitable for management software
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Functional base, needs business-specific enhancement

**Typography:**

- **Current**: Inter font family with Tailwind defaults
- **Mobile Priority**: Readable sizes for tablet/mobile use
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Good foundation, needs mobile optimization

**Component Library:**

- **Base**: Shadcn/ui components (buttons, forms, navigation, etc.)
- **Custom**: ACM-specific business components needed
- **Status**: üîÑ Needs ACM-specific component creation

**Spacing & Layout:**

- **Grid System**: Tailwind's responsive grid
- **Mobile-First**: Breakpoints optimized for tablet usage
- **Status**: üîÑ Needs mobile-first optimization

**Next Steps:**

1. Create design system documentation
2. Establish ACM brand colors and themes
3. Build component showcase/storybook
4. Define mobile-first spacing standards

### Navigation Structure

‚úÖ **DECIDED: Hybrid Role-Based + Dashboard-Centric**

**Core Principles:**

- Role-based navigation (users only see what they can access)
- Dashboard-centric landing pages with quick actions
- Mobile-first navigation pattern

**Landing Page Strategy:**

- **Managers/Assistants**: Hybrid dashboard showing location key metrics + personal info quick access
- **Area Managers**: Multi-location overview + team management shortcuts
- **Admin/Office**: Comprehensive dashboard + admin tools access

**Navigation Pattern Recommendation:**

- **Mobile/Tablet**: Bottom navigation bar (4-5 primary sections) + hamburger for secondary features
- **Desktop**: Sidebar navigation that collapses on smaller screens
- **All Devices**: Personalized dashboard as primary landing page

**Role-Based Menu Structure:**

- **MANAGER/ASSISTANT**: Dashboard, My Payroll, My Location, [Help/Settings]
- **SUPERVISOR**: Dashboard, Team Payroll, Locations, Reports, [Settings]
- **ADMIN**: Dashboard, Payroll, Locations, Reports, Admin, [Settings]

_Note: Exact menu items will be refined during implementation based on feature development_

### Responsive Strategy

‚úÖ **DECIDED: Mobile-First with Adaptive Navigation**

**Navigation Approach:**

- **Mobile/Tablet (Primary)**: Bottom tab navigation for main sections
- **Desktop**: Collapsible sidebar navigation
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: Mobile ‚Üí Tablet ‚Üí Desktop progression

**Key Responsive Principles:**

- Dashboard cards stack on mobile, grid on larger screens
- Data tables become scrollable cards on mobile
- Charts maintain readability across all devices
- Touch-friendly interface elements (44px minimum touch targets)
